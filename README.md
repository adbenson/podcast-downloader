# podcast-downloader

This project contains 3 versions of the same basic Python program which downloads podcast episodes from a public FTP server.

The purpose of this is to teach programming skills through example.

Running these programs is as simple as [downloading and installing Python on your computer](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), then either double-clicking the `.py` file
or opening a command line and running `py ftp-download_v1.py` (or whichever one you want).

Though not required, it's recommended you use a full-featured text editor like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/),
or a proper integrated development environment (IDE) like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

This project is also available online in [GitHub](https://github.com/adbenson/podcast-downloader).

## Files

* `ftp-download_v1.py`
	* Just downloads one file specified by name in the code
* `ftp-download_v2.py`
	* Downloads all files for a date given at the top of the file
* `ftp-download_v3.py`
	* Breaks the program down into small functions and can automatically find the files by today's date
